#### 1. press:  presses the keyboard keys

For example:

```
press win+r
```

And we all know what happens when we press windows key + r
 It will open run pad


Then the next is type command which is just same as the echo command of cmd / batch script that will print the text we want

And these two are the most basic commands of asst prompt.

Have you noticed a function ascii is added in the code where all the commands are mentioned

Yes it is for converting image to ascii format.

Just type ascii and hit enter. Then type the path of the image, it will convert it to ascii.

The solve command is another command in asst prompt which will help us to solve algebra and alongside there is a factor command for factorization of algebraic expression. When combined and used as ```solve factor expression of your choice``` can also divide the polynomials. The credit goes to the creators of sympy module.

#### There is also a function named delete this acts just like the del command of command prompt.

Bin converts the numbers to binnary code.

@ separates common words and characters from the sentence or string.

ip command calls the ip address of the website

inspect shows the code of inspect column of a webpage.

open command opens the required link or a path of our pc.

There is also a thing named late value and ease var in asst prompt that I have added.

late value refers to the line, character, integer or string that is after the question mark

likewise ease var refers to the line, character, integer or string before the string

For Example:

```
asst--> a?b
late value: {'b'} ease var: {'a'}
```
With the help of late value and ease var we can also find average and many other things.

Like:
For average

```
asst--> 2,4,6?#
6
late value: {'#'} ease var: {'2,4,6'}
4.0
```

Ignore the number 6 that is displayed.

For getting biggest number written among many numbers
```
asst--> 1,2,4,34,6,8?! 
late value: {'!'} ease var: {'1,2,4,34,6,8'}
34
```

* Note: except late value and ease var all other commands should be before the line and there should be space in each of them.
